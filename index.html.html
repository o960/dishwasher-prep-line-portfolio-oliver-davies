      <p>Dependable, detail-oriented Dishwasher, Line Cook, and Team Member experienced in the standards that meet high-volume kitchens. Known for kitchen compliance, continuous improvement, and team communication during peak service. Experienced with conveyor and door-type dish machines, 3-compartment sink workflows, chemical concentration control (quats/chlorine), and temperature logging compliant with Public Health/HACCP best practices. I enjoy being part of systematic, adaptable, organized, and durable teams that provide delicious food; I take a little time to warm up in a new team, but once settled I build confidence quickly and deliver consistent speed and quality.</p>
